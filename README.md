# [test.learnyouahaskell.github.io 0.1.0](https://github.com/chrisdenman/test.learnyouahaskell.github.io)

This project provides functional testing for
the [Learn You A Haskell for Great Good](https://github.com/learnyouahaskell/learnyouahaskell.github.io) GitHub project,
which is an
open-source fork of the most excellent [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](https://learnyouahaskell.com/) by Miran
Lipovača.

#### Operation

1. Token substitution is performed initially.
2. Then all forward-slash characters '/' are replaced by their platform-dependant equivalents.

## System Requirements

- Java (see [Testing](#Testing))

Although the JVM/Gradle applications may be run using any system with a suitable Java installation. The supporting scripts
are written in Bash and likely require an up-to-date Linux based system.

The Bash scripts check their own dependency requirements.

SDKMAN! initialization files [`.sdkmanrc`](./.sdkmanrc) files are included for convenience.

# Execution

## Tests

The Selenium tests (including the screenshotting) are executed by invoking the [`test`](./test) script in the
repository's root
directory passing the path to the configuration file as the sole argument's value.

More information can be found within the [`test`](./test) script itself, but as an example:

```shell
./test $(pwd)/config/learnyouahaskell/main.json
```

## Comparing Output Images

The intention of the screenshot functionality is twofold:

1. To provide quick comfort that [learnyouahaskell.github.io](https://learnyouahaskell.github.io) has not
   suffered any drastic regression.
2. To provide an easy means of comparing page presentation across different browsers spanning code and content changes.

The included script [`comp`](./comp) may be used to compare screenshot output sets. This is useful when
comparing screenshots from a known good branch with those of another.

The [`comp`](./comp) script compares two directories of images to firstly, ensure they contain identically named files,
and
subsequently compares the images using `ImageMagick` signature functionality to ensure they are indeed invariant.

When two identically named images are found to differ, `ImageMagick` is utilized once again to produce a flicker diagram
which helps greatly in highlighting differences between two presumed identical images.

A typical invocation of the [`comp`](./comp) script would look something like:

```shell
./comp \
  screenshots/branch1/firefox/1024x800 \      # 🔵 Images path 1
  screenshots/branch2/firefox/1024x800 \      # 🔵 Images path 2
  "png" \                                     # 🔵 Input image file extension (case insensitive)
  out/firefox/1024x800                        # 🟢 Output directory 
```

More information can be found within the [`comp`](./comp) script itself.
